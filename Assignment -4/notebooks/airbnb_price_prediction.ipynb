    "- **Neural Networks outperform XGBoost in most big cities** (e.g., NYC, LA, SF, Chicago) with lower RMSE and higher R², indicating better fit for complex, high-volume markets.\n",
    "- **XGBoost performs better in small cities** (e.g., Asheville, Salem, Columbus) with lower RMSE and MAE, suggesting tree-based models handle sparse data better.\n",
    "- **NN Architecture 1 (128-64-32-1) generally performs best** among NN variants, with Architecture 2 showing mixed results.\n",
    "- **Overall trend**: NN better for large markets, XGBoost for small markets."

    "# Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Major Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Individual City Performance**: \n",
    "   - XGBoost generally outperformed Neural Networks in most cities, especially in smaller markets.\n",
    "   - Neural Networks showed better performance in larger, more complex markets like NYC and LA.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tier Analysis**:\n",
    "   - XGBoost performed better in medium and small tiers.\n",
    "   - Neural Networks showed competitive performance in big city markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-Tier Generalization**:\n",
    "   - Models trained on big cities generalized poorly to smaller markets.\n",
    "   - Models trained on small cities performed reasonably well on larger markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market Complexity**: Neural Networks benefit from larger datasets and complex patterns in big cities.\n",
    "- **Data Efficiency**: XGBoost performs well with smaller datasets typical of medium/small cities.\n",
    "- **Generalization**: Tier-specific training is preferable to cross-tier application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use XGBoost for medium and small city price prediction.\n",
    "- Consider Neural Networks for big city markets with sufficient data.\n",
    "- Train separate models for different market tiers rather than attempting cross-tier generalization."
